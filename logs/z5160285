Week 1

Our group was formed and we set up Jira. For this week I decided to write most of the user stories and asked group members to add on any user stories I had missed.
During our group meeting we discussed what we expected out of this project and how we would tackle the project. Everyone had to brush up on the necessary skills (Flask, React) 
to prepare for our sprints.
