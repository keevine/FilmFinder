Week 1

Our group was formed and we set up Jira. For this week I decided to write most of the user stories and asked group members to add on any user stories I had missed.
During our group meeting we discussed what we expected out of this project and how we would tackle the project. Everyone had to brush up on the necessary skills (Flask, React) 
to prepare for our sprints. 

For next week we planned to finish cleaning up our database. This was handled by Peter and Kevin. Also we had to make a start on our project proposal which Aidan made a start with.

Week 2
For this week I added acceptance criteria for all user stories. In our meeting we planned to have completed our project proposal and go over it as a group next week before
submitting. Additionally I completed our initial story board for the website and planned to finish the flow diagrams next week. Steven added more user stories that
related to the novelty mark. 

For next week I planned to finish our flow diagrams and refine the story boards. Everyone would then combine their parts into the proposal before we had a final review
and submitted our work.
