-- Week 1: Meeting 1 (Thu)--
Formed the group and created Jira
 We started writing up the user stories together based on the project spec/overview on a google doc.
TODO: put the stories on Jira, flask research

-- Week 1: Meeting 2 (Fri) --
I put the user stories onto Jira
I created the boiler plate code in react and flask.
Then I downloaded a movie database and a credits database. I did a little bit of cleaning and then created a movies.db to be used in flask with flask-rest-plus to create a little api in the backend
On the frontend I set up React with React Hooks. It can make calls to the Flask-Rest-Plus API to get movies and filter movies. This was really slow
TODO: Novelty stuff, clean database, start proposal, storyboards, get everyone developing

-- Week 1: Meeting 3 (Tue) --
I put the databse files onto the cloud so Kevin could clean it up - there was a lot of uneccessary info to get rid of + some syntax preferences
Aidan started the proposal, I put my zid and email in the cover page
Steven wrote up the novelty aspects on Jira
Michael wrote the aceptance criteria for the user stories on Jira
Github access was released I uploaded my work onto Github for the rest of the team to Steven
I created API routes for filtering movies by title name and getting movies by id
Then I created the search page on the front end as well as the full details page - this stuff works now.
TODO: Write up architecture + user stories + first sprint in proposal, determine the database structure including Users/Reviews/Actors tables

-- Week 2: Meeting 1 (Thu) --
I started to write/draw up the web app architecture
