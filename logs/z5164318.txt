-- Week 1: Meeting 1 (Thu)--
Formed the group and created Jira
 We started writing up the user stories together based on the project spec/overview on a google doc.
TODO: put the stories on Jira, flask research

-- Week 1: Meeting 2 (Fri) --
I put the user stories onto Jira
I created the boiler plate code in react and flask.
Then I downloaded a movie database and a credits database. I did a little bit of cleaning and then created a movies.db to be used in flask with flask-rest-plus to create a little api in the backend
On the frontend I set up React with React Hooks. It can make calls to the Flask-Rest-Plus API to get movies and filter movies. This was really slow
TODO: Novelty stuff, clean database, start proposal, storyboards, get everyone developing

-- Week 1: Meeting 3 (Tue) --
I put the databse files onto the cloud so Kevin could clean it up - there was a lot of uneccessary info to get rid of + some syntax preferences
Aidan started the proposal, I put my zid and email in the cover page
Steven wrote up the novelty aspects on Jira
Michael wrote the aceptance criteria for the user stories on Jira
Github access was released I uploaded my work onto Github for the rest of the team to Steven
I created API routes for filtering movies by title name and getting movies by id
Then I created the search page on the front end as well as the full details page - this stuff works now.
TODO: Write up architecture + user stories + first sprint in proposal, determine the database structure including Users/Reviews/Actors tables

-- Week 2: Meeting 1 (Thu) --
I started to write/draw up the web app architecture diagram
This was quite difficult since I couldn't find a standard for drawing a software architecture diagram so i just tried my best
Extra detail was added to the diagram by including the technologies table.
As a group we figure out what things ne
The group decided to skip the Friday meeting as we needed more time to complete our proposal tasks

-- Week 2: Meeting 2 (Tue) --
I wrote up the external actors table
As a group we ran through the parts of the proposal rubric/marking criteria and compared it to what we had completed
Then we delegated the remaining tasks and discussed any queries we had
I added an explanation part to the proposal
We planned to finish off the proposal after asking questions during our tutorial.

-- Week 3: Meeting 1 (Thu) --
We talked about the proposal and listened to what our tutor had to say, especially with regards to storyboards and flow diagrams
The first sprint will be commencing and will encompass our main objectives for the coming days
For the next meeting I want to get everyone working on the project from their own computers!

-- Week 3: Meeting 2 (Sun) --
Added flow diagrams and the wireframes to the proposal. These diagrams were difficult to make with draw.io so we switched over to using the balsamiq prototyping software
Submitted proposal
The first sprint has started
We will need to find a way to get the data base up 
I need to create a document for the team to get things working -> might work on this with michael/steven then share to the rest of the team.
