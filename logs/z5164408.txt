Today we met up again. We finished the initial draft of the user stories and did some refreshing on flaks and python.
We also made some progress on what was not planned for today,
coming up with the website boilerplate for the api, db and front end
as well as downloading the initial data for the database and making a rudimentary database
We had some initial trouble with jira but managed to get past it in the end.

TO DO: Still to be done are the novelty user stories, cleaning the database and the storyboards which will
hopefully be done over the next week.

Peter has generated the database file as well as some basic functions to access it.
