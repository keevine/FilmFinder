Week 1
Created a group and joined the Jira our team made. The first week was spent reading the project proposal outline and assigning work to each other.
We decided to do the film finder project and during our first meeting began writing out the user stories as a team.
Before we next met up I was assigned to think about what routes we would need (we had decided to create our project using python and flask)

Week 2
This week as a team we all worked on starting the Project proposal. I was given the task of thinking of novelty ideas for our film finder project.
I helped add to the user stories section and the sprint section of the Project Proposal. Next week we aim to finish off the proposal and get ready
to start coding.
